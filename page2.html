            Urashima Taro lived with his old mother.
            He went to the sea shore one day and found some kids beating up a turtle.

            Taro did not want to stay long because he worried about his mother. However, when he is greeted by a beautiful princess 
            and given lots of food and things to enjoy he forgets about his life before.

            After a few days he remembers his old mother and wants to head back home. The princess gives him a jewel box that she says he 
            should never open.

            When he returns, three hundred years had actually passed and all his family was dead. He goes by the shore and decides to open the box.
            In a puff of smoke, Taro redeems his years of aging causing him to die.
